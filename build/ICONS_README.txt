Icon Files Required for Windows Build
========================================

Please place the following icon files in this directory:

1. icon.ico (Windows icon, 256x256)
   - This is used for the Windows executable

2. icon.png (PNG icon, 512x512)
   - This is used for the application window

You can create these icons from the Twitch logo or a custom design.

Recommended tools for creating icons:
- Online: https://icoconvert.com/
- Desktop: GIMP, Photoshop, or Inkscape

Twitch Brand Resources:
- https://brand.twitch.tv/

The icons should feature the Twitch purple (#9147FF) and be recognizable
as related to Twitch Channel Points monitoring.

Until you add custom icons, the application will use default Electron icons.
